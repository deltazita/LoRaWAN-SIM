# LoRaWAN-SIM
A LoRaWAN simulator for confirmed/unconfirmed transmissions and multiple gateways

The first version of the simulator was used here:

}

## Features:
- Multiple half-duplex gateways
- 1% radio duty cycle for uplink transmissions
- 1 or 10% radio duty cycle for downlink transmissions
- Two receive windows (RX1, RX2) for ACKs and commands
- Non-orthogonal SF transmissions
- Capture effect
- Path-loss signal attenuation model
- Multiple channels
- Collision handling for both uplink+downlink transmissions
- Proper header overhead
- Node energy consumption calculation (uplink+downlink)
- ADR (Tx power adjustment)
- Downlink policies
- Adjustable packet size and rate

## Dependencies:
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Random
- https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::SVG
- https://metacpan.org/dist/Statistics-Basic/view/lib/Statistics/Basic.pod

Debian: apt install libmath-random-perl libgd-svg-perl libstatistics-basic-perl

## Usage:
```
perl generate_terrain.pl terrain_side_size_(m) num_of_nodes num_of_gateways > terrain.txt
perl LoRaWAN.pl packets_per_hour simulation_time_(hours) terrain.txt
```

### Example with 3000x3000m terrain size, 1000 nodes, 5 gateways, 1pkt/5min, 10h sim time:
```
perl generate_terrain.pl 3000 1000 5 > terrain.txt
(or perl generate_terrain.pl 3000 1000 > terrain.txt to automatically select the number of required gateways)
perl LoRaWAN.pl 12 10 terrain.txt
```
