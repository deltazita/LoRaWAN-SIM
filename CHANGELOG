CHANGELOG
----------
v2025.08.13
* added statistics about the duty cycle of each gateway per band/channel (useful with confirmed traffic)
* downlink statistics of gateways are shown even with unconfirmed traffic (minor traffic due to ADR tx commands)
* updated the test file to include end-devices of all SFs and added the terrain svg file

v2025.05.27
* %surpressed items are now deleted once transmissions are preceded to reduce memory consumption
* removed %nacked_uniq as it is not required anymore

v2025.04.27
* the US915 version is now included in the EU868 version. It can be selected in line 86
* the US915 frequency plan does not currently support SF8BW500 (TODO)
* confirmed transmissions are disabled by default (see line 124 to enable them)
* by default, all transmissions are with a fixed rate and packet size (can be changed in lines 140 and 144)
* the payload size is rounded to the next multiple of 16
* a PRR or an energy consumption map (SVG format) is generated by default (can be changed in line 139 and 650)
* minor fixes

v2025.04.13-EU868
* changed some statistics to be more comprehensible
    ** Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) is now calculated as (total unique packets received) / (total unique packets transmitted)
    ** Confirmed Packet Deliver Ratio (CPDR) is introduced and calculated as (unique packets acked) / (unique packets transmitted)
    ** Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) is now calculated as (total packets received) / (total packets transmitted)
* the duty cycle for uplinks is now a variable (given as the airtime multiplier for the next transmission)
* removed unused variables
* confirmed the correctness of the simulator using real-world experiments as part of a project with industry (see https://research.nu.edu.kz/en/projects/analysis-and-improvement-proposal-of-deeptrack-loralorawan-networ)

v2024.12.4-EU868
* fixed next tx time according to the duty cycle per band
* fixed a print error with total packets delivered
* fixed random channel assignment in confirmed transmissions

v2024.9.16-EU868
* fixed the PRR calculation when confirmed transmissions are enabled

v2024.6.16-EU868
* added support for 8x2 channel gateways (enable by setting $double_gws=1)

v2024.6.13-EU868
* fixed ADR mechanism
* default db margin is set to 5
* new test.txt file

v2024.5.31-EU868
* fixed an error with gateway unavailability
* removed gateway selection policy from the list of arguments
* the simulation time is now given in hours instead of seconds
* replaced progress bar with a simple more efficient method
* added gateway transmission power (25dBm by default)
* other minor changes and fixes

v2024.5.14-EU868
* fixed a bug with zero confirmed traffic

v2024.3.27-EU868
* minor fixes
* added a sample terrain file

v2024.1.14-EU868
* fixed some inconsistencies
* added ADR support for unconfirmed traffic
* some code refactoring

v2023.6.27
* fixed minor errors

v2023.6.6-EU868
* fixed energy consumption prints
* EDs stay in idle mode between reveive windows

v2023.1.25
* added a changelog file
* added a US915 version (work in progress)
* fixed the new channel selection after every transmission for unconfirmed traffic
* fixed an uninitialized value in stats for unconfirmed traffic
